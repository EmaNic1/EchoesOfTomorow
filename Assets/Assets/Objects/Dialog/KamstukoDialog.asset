  - I see you're new here... You're not the first one thrown out by the machine.
  - You're probably wondering what kind of machine this is. We called that machine
    a time node. Every now and then, the machine sends people back to the past, when
    the world wasn't... destroyed.
  - Calm down. And so from the past. As far as you are concerned, you are now in
    the future.
  - Some kind of technology... Don't get too carried away, you won't understand it
    now anyway. The most important thing now is for you to survive here... If you
    can.
  - So this place is called the Valley of Ruins. We named it that way because of
    how everything looks now. Long ago, this place was amazing. But that's not what
    we're talking about now...
  - The survivors have formed communities, trying to survive in their own ways. You
    too will have to find a way to survive. Here, take this paper, it will help you
    decide how you can help our community.
  - And before I forget, here's a detour map. The brightest places on the map are
    now safe. I would advise you to be careful of the dark places on the map, after
    the crisis, strange things started happening here...
  - Well, I wish you luck. Don't die.
