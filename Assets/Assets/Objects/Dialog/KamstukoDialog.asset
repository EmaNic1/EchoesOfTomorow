  - I see you're new here... You're not the first one thrown out by the machine.
  - You're probably wondering what kind of machine this is. We called that machine
    a time node. Every now and then, the machine sends people back to the past, when
    the world wasn't... destroyed.
  - So this place is called the Valley of Ruins. We named it that way because of
    how everything looks now. Long ago, this place was amazing. But that's not what
    we're talking about now...
  - 'The survivors have formed communities, trying to survive in their own ways.
    You too will have to find a way to survive. '
  - Before you start doing anything, you must choose a profession that will help
    our community grow.
  - And before I forget, I want to warn you! Be careful of the nearby forest... After
    the crisis, strange things started happening there.
  - Well, I wish you luck. Don't die.
